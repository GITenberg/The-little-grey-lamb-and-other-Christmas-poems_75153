It has been a habit of mine, for some years,
to send an annual Christmas greeting to my
friends in the form of a little poem.  Of the
following selections most have been published in
the annual Christmas number of the <i>Town-Crier</i>
of Seattle, whose editors kindly permit
their reproduction.  They are reprinted because
some have liked one or other of the poems
sufficiently well to request this; also because I feel
that the treatment of the Christmas story may
be fresh enough and varied enough to win the
liking of some others.  H.H.G.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
<a id="message"></a>
<span class="gothic">The Christmas Message</span>
</h3>

<p>
The story is told that when King Edward
I of England sought to reconcile the Welsh
people to his rule he presented to the assembled
chiefs his baby son, just born in Caernarvon
Castle, as a native son of Wales to be their
prince.  The king manifested in the act a very
sound appreciation of what is, according to the
Christmas story, the heart of the divine
method for reconciling a rebellious world to
God.  For the divine fact which makes the
Christmas festival so dear to all alike, and
draws together them that are afar off and them
that are nigh is nothing less than that the Child
who comes to reign in a world of human hearts
is truly named the Son of Man.
</p>

<p>
That the jarring interests of a warring
world may be brought together in one common
devotion to the best is always plain when we
substitute the child attitude for the selfish and
sophisticated ideas of men soiled by too long
contact with material things.  And when men
return to the child mind, with its simplicity, its
purity, and its ready response to love, the
world will certainly be a little nearer to that
emulous heaven which yearns downward to
touch the earth as the earth at Christmas time
seems to be doing its best to reach the skies.
The celebration of such a truth is the best
antidote for the horrible doctrine of an absentee
God and of a humanity left to wander unaided
in the dark.
</p>

<p>
In the great temple, Shi Tenno-ji, in Osaka,
is the shrine of the Guiding Bell.  The rope is
made up of the bibs of dead children, and little
Japanese go thither in order that by ringing
the bell they may help and be helped along the
road to Paradise.  The Christmas bells are
always guiding bells to all mankind.  Wherever
they ring, whether they sound only in the
imagination which carries us back to the days of
long ago, they summon man unfailingly to a
Paradise wherein all may become as little
children in the spirit of faith and hope and love.
</p>

<p>
And wherever these bells are heard the heart
will never cease to sing and dance away the
dust of the world and charm men from the
sordidness which keeps us back from entry
within the gates of gold.
</p>

<p>
"A little child shall lead them"&mdash;this is the
veridical prophecy of the good days to come.
In fulfilment of such a prophecy let us share the
good-heartedness and charity of the Christmas
season.  Let us lend our ears to hear once more
the song which, though it comes from heaven
through the voice of angels, has its message
for the souls of men on earth.  Let us turn our
backs upon the selfish and the discordant till
the angelic anthem is echoed back with human
voice to the Throne of God.  Then heaven and
earth shall have become one indeed.

  The Little Grey Lamb<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>A simple tale of long ago,<br>
  How the little grey lamb became white as snow.</i><br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  On Bethlehem's hills on a winter night,<br>
  Shepherds kept watch in the cold star-light.<br>
  The sheep, safely folded, were fast asleep:<br>
  There was nought to trouble their slumber deep.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one little grey lamb was filled with woe<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he longed to be white as the winter snow.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then sudden the heavens grew bright like noon,<br>
  With a light which was neither of sun nor moon.<br>
  And music rained down ineffably sweet,<br>
  As the shepherds sprang to their trembling feet.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sheep slumbered on through that wonderful night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save the little grey lamb who longed to be white.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then forth from the skies came an angel's voice:<br>
  "Good tidings, ye shepherds!  God bids you rejoice.<br>
  In Bethlehem's inn the Child ye shall see,<br>
  Who is born to make all men happy and free."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then swiftly they journeyed the Christ Child to find,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the little grey lamb followed closely behind.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  From his little white heart rose a timid prayer:<br>
  "Is it only for men, O Baby most fair,<br>
  Thou hast cleansing from all that is sinful and bad?<br>
  Wilt Thou not heal me and make me glad?"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he followed the shepherds and entered with them,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they came to the stable of Bethlehem.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They entered, they worshipped, and homeward returned,<br>
  While a solemn joy in their bosoms burned:<br>
  But the little grey lamb nestled close in the hay,<br>
  Quite close to the crib where the Baby lay.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a tiny hand stole forth from the bed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rested awhile on the little lamb's head.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  At that touch there passed a wonderful thrill<br>
  Through the lamb as he lay by the crib so still:<br>
  He felt all his sadness melting away,<br>
  As the night mists scatter at break of day.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little grey lamb in that holy glow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew he was white as the driven snow.<br>
</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>May the Christ Child today this blessing bestow,<br>

II.
<br><br>
<span class="gothic">Jerusalem, 1917</span>
</h3>

<p>
<i>No incident of the Great War gripped the imagination
of the Christian world so much as the taking
of Jerusalem in December, 1917, by General (Lord)
Allenby.  Though an incident in war, it yet had in it
the promise of peace, since no shot was fired against
the Holy City and the victorious commander entered
the city on foot without parade of war.</i>

<p class="t3b gothic">
  Jerusalem 1917<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O Mother, with the halo round thy brow,<br>
  Yet conscious of the Cross which looms so near&mdash;<br>
  What is the grim surprise which greets thee now?<br>
  What spectre grips thy maiden heart with fear?<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  What is it that, with half-averted face,<br>
  Thou seest sweep across the holy land,<br>
  Where all the towers and domes of David's race<br>
  From age to age in silent witness stand?<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  How ill, meseems, become those sacred fields<br>
  The tramp of warriors and the blast of war,<br>
  The gleam of steel and shock of swords and shields,<br>
  The noise of cannon booming from afar!<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Is this the peace the angels sang when high<br>
  The glory burst upon the shepherds lone?<br>
  Is this the promised dawn when all the sky<br>
  Flamed with good news from Heaven's Almighty Throne?<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Yet constant shines the Star from out the dark,<br>
  Heaven's finger touching earth with silvery ray.<br>
  Though Time tell of despair and misery stark,<br>
  Eternity assures us of the day.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O Mother with the sword within thy breast,<br>
  The Child Divine within thine arms may see,<br>
  E'en from thy lap, the issue sure, the rest<br>
  For man appointed after victory.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And when, in later years, He shall ascend<br>
  The painful Cross, He shall be satisfied,<br>
  And all the travail and the strife shall blend<br>
  In manhood, saved, redeemed, beatified.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O Child, in Mother's arms thus nurs'd and held,<br>
  Give us from love like her's to wake and rise,<br>
  Till from the Cross we see the dark dispell'd,<br>
  The City of God descending from the skies.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Give us Thy courage firm, Thy patience long,<br>
  Thy willingness to suffer for the right;<br>
  O give us of Thy faith, Thy love so strong,<br>
  The vision of the victory of the right.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Jerusalem, encompassed with arms,<br>
  Shall yet become the city of the free,<br>
  And discord, hatred, war, and war's alarms<br>
  Shall disappear for all eternity.<br>

  The Quest of the Christ<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In the dark night, while all around me sleep,<br>
  My questing thoughts go backward through the years,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To find and bring some worthy thing<br>
  Shall waken life from out its slumber deep&mdash;<br>
  Shall scatter lowering clouds of doubts and fears,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crown Love King.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Taking old forms from tales of days long dead,<br>
  Like slow beasts padding softly through the night&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, far or nigh, I shall descry<br>
  Somewhere my Bethlehem&mdash;so piloted<br>
  By tinkling bells of hope that catch the light<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of star-lit sky.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I know not where my search for Christ shall end&mdash;<br>
  The kings and priests I question answer not.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps their will is still to kill:&mdash;<br>
  Perchance He seeks to walk with me as friend:&mdash;<br>
  Or, all unknown, shares the despised one's lot,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rejected still.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Yet am I sure that I shall know the sign;<br>
  My heart shall wake and cry: "This&mdash;This is He!"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him shall I find, however blind<br>
  And slow to recognize the hand divine.<br>
  He shall His own unfailing witness be:&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him shall I find.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And, oh, what joy the news abroad to speed,<br>
  That men from sorrow as from toil who sleep<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May hear the song that Heaven's throng<br>
  Brings down to earth, and so be comforted<br>
  For woes that make strong men like women weep,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the wrong.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then all the dark shall melt into the dawn;<br>
  Like jewels of the New Jerusalem,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth's streets shall shine with light divine,<br>
  And all her roof-tops gladden with the morn;<br>
  Then every home shall be a Bethlehem<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Christ is born.<br>

  What the Wise Men Saw<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Back to their homes returned, the Wise Men three<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reported on the King they went to see.<br>
  Said they: "The star our guide, the King we found;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now are we hither come His praise to sound."<br>
  Then said the Wisest of them all: "'Tis well;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was He like?  First let the youngest tell."<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What was He like?  Why, this my task<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is surely easy, answering what you ask.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was so young: His was the spirit of youth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ardent and hopeful, forward-faced; in truth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His courage seemed to leap from height to height,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like golden sunshine driving back the night.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I my beating heart obeyed;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fine gold at His feet I laid."<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "And you, our next in years, what did you see<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this your King?  Pray, tell, what like was He?"<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What was He like?  Yea, sir, although<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not as my brother saw Him saw I so.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His was our manhood's prime; from out His eyes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience looked, and wisdom: sacrifice<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waited the altar whereon lifted high,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruised but not crushed, He saw His destiny.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So drew I incense from my store,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruised too, but odorous the more."<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Well said!  But you, our eldest, tell us, pray:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was He like?  How saw you Him that day?"<br>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What was He like?  I saw Him sage<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the gifts that spring from ripest age;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eyes that beheld the eternal; youth and prime<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both clean forgot, with all the things of time;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond all earthly effort, passion, strife;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond all heart-ache, pain or lust of life.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not Him my myrrh deny,<br>

  Then some, less wise than meet, looked up and smiled.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Symbol eternal, and Fact, Prediction sublime!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read the sweet story of Love, upheld in the arms of Time!<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till, chosen the Bride of God, she bring forth, washed clean<br>

<p class="poem">
  Far back in the youth of the world, out of water and mist and slime,<br>
  I see thee, Earth-Mother, arise, both Mother and Daughter of Time&mdash;<br>
  Stern, sacrificially cruel, with passionate spirit aflame,<br>
  Cybele, Ishtar, Isis, adored under many a name,<br>
  Striving through waste and through weakness, onward and upward ever,<br>
  Slain for Love's sake and slaying, yet failing in sacrifice never,<br>
  Bearing with anguish of heart, big with the life of the morrow,<br>
  Lifting our soul from the soil, thy Body transfixed with our sorrow&mdash;<br>
  Till, lo, the fair fruitage of life, upheld in thine arms for<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a Throne,<br>
  Opens eyes to the kiss of God, His Child, yet thy very own.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Far back ere the brooding wing of the Spirit o'er Chaos stirred,<br>
  God thought of Creation to be, and His Thought took flesh as<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Word&mdash;<br>
  Child of eternal Love, awaiting the fulness of days,<br>
  Downward descending in dreams, seeking our earthward ways,<br>
  Struggling for birth through the ages, piercing through many a cloud,<br>
  Worshipped at many an altar, wherever faces were bowed,<br>
  Or hands uplifted to Heaven in passionate yearning to see<br>
  In thy Face the transfiguring vision of life-giving Deity.<br>
  Till, lo, the idea of God, His Child, thou art brought to birth,<br>
  Making glad all thy brethren to be, and thy Mother the travailing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Child of Heaven, to whom all hearts aspire,<br>

  O Virginal mother of men, in whose fathomless eyes&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft eyes too familiar with tears,<br>
  Past sorrow and faith in the future both wistfully wait<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gladness that comes with the years!<br>
  Asleep on your breast and content, that futurity lies,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor frets nor frowns at its fate.<br>
  While half to yourself and half to your baby you sing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story undying miraculous Christmases bring:<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "There came three kings from far away, from far away,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from far away,<br>
  And o'er the crib of Bethlehem their guiding star its<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;course did stay.<br>
  Along the road beneath that star the way ahead like<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silver shone:<br>

  While, full in that ray, as on stairway of stars, descend,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In robes of splendor bedight,<br>
  Three kingships on pilgrimage questing, with Heaven their aid,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And God within them their friend.<br>
  They move all majestical onward, as eager to greet<br>
  The slumbering Infant who draws them to kneel at His feet.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Love that kneels only to Love,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Love is endowed from above.<br>
  How else could mortality offer such worship to man,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or clay so reverence clay,<br>

  IV.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vessel fashioned so fair;<br>
  In gladness releasing, as incense that floats to the sky,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The odors of sacrifice sweet;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hands that grope as they bear<br>
  No visible gift, and with footsteps that feel for the light,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with eyes turned inward, from fear<br>
  Lest soon all their questing be ended, lest soon they shall fill<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their seeing with fullness of sight;<br>
  Still wise in their seeking for wisdom, yet wiser to be<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some earnest of Heaven's new day,<br>
  When all things on earth, or in heaven, or in hell's blackest night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bow down to give praise evermore&mdash;<br>

  'Emmanuel'&mdash;'God with us all'&mdash;this is solace, we deem,<br>

  A Prayer for the New Year<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O God, whose days are without end and Whose years cannot<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be numbered!<br>
  We, the seeming creatures of a day, reach onward through<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the passing years<br>
  To claim Thy kinship in Eternity.<br>
  We thank Thee for the solemn pause wherein we put the dead<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;past behind us,<br>
  And face the new unknown with courage new.<br>
  Lift up over Thy bewildered world the sunshine of Thy presence<br>
  That we this year may see the world, Thy handiwork,<br>
  Emerge victorious, purposeful from Chaos,<br>
  Grant us to see, clear of cloud and battle-smoke,<br>
  The Eternal City, real before our eyes,<br>
  Stable on earth, the world of all our dreams,<br>
  Home of men reconciled, redeemed from hate.<br>
  Grant us to see Creation, after travail pangs,<br>
  With Love again made young, young Hope within her arms,<br>
  Her sorrows healed, her tears to pearls transformed.<br>
  Then we, strangers and sojourners of Time, shall gird ourselves<br>
  For the march which ends not but in rest with Thee.<br>
  O hang the lamp of hope above our onward path;<br>
  Give clearer light to understand the things which hitherto were dark;<br>
  Give strength to work the work for which our hands were hitherto<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;too feeble;<br>
  Enlarge our hearts to love all that is worthy love, though<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hitherto unloved;<br>
  Whatever seed Thou scatterest along these unknown days ahead,<br>
  Help us to reap therefrom harvests of blessing for ourselves<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and others<br>
  Which Thou wilt garner safe beyond the flux of years.<br>
